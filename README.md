## Introduction

The Agama OATH TOTP repository is designed to provide a robust framework for testing and implementing TOTP. TOTP is widely used for two-factor authentication (2FA) and enhances security by generating a temporary code that users must enter along with their passwords. This repository aims to facilitate the exploration and testing of TOTP implementations.

## Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Uses TOTP for secure user verification.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate with existing systems.
- **Extensive Testing**: Comprehensive test cases to ensure reliability.
- **Documentation**: Clear guidelines and examples for usage.
- **Modular Design**: Components can be reused across different projects.

## Topics

This repository covers a variety of topics relevant to modern authentication methods:

- Agama
- Casa
- Email
- Federation
- Jans
- Janss
- M2F (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- OAuth
- OAuth2
- OTP (One-Time Password)
- Password Management
- Password Generator
- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
- TOTP
- USB Authentication
- Verification

## Installation

To get started with the Agama OATH TOTP repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ParthMahapadi/agama-OATH-TOTP.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd agama-OATH-TOTP
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies. If you are using Python, for example, you can use:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installing the repository, you can start using it. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to generate a TOTP code:

```python
from totp import TOTP

# Initialize TOTP with a secret key
totp = TOTP("JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP")

# Generate a TOTP code
code = totp.now()
print(f"Your TOTP code is: {code}")
```

This code snippet initializes a TOTP instance with a secret key and generates a one-time password. You can replace the secret key with your own.

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/ParthMahapadi/agama-OATH-TOTP).
